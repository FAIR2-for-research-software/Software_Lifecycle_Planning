## Overview

The application of the [FAIR principles][fair] (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) to a [research
software][fair4rs] project is easier when you plan the development of your software. Considering who is in charge of the
development, what tools will be used, who will be in charge of its long term maintenance and what the potential risks
are related to software development are all important aspects of a successful software project. This course will
introduce these ideas in the context of creating FAIR software for your research. Planning the development of your
research software will help you with organisation and resource management, long term sustainability, and intellectual
property aspects.

We will start by introducing some definitions (What is a research software? How software is traditionally developed?)
and then dive into the concept of research Software Management Plans (SMPs) and discuss why it is important to plan for
the development of your software.

Then are two important aspects of software development in the context of software in academia which influence the
development of the Software Management Plan:

- **Licences and Intellectual Property**: Software is a creative work and as soon as it is created it automatically
  attracts copyright protection. This means that if you want other people to be able to use your software without having
  to ask you directly you need to apply a licence to it. We will look at why licensing matters, how to choose a licence
  and what the implications are when you want to build on other people’s openly licensed software.

- **Dissemination**: While putting your software online certainly helps it satisfy the FAIR principles, simply doing so
  might not be enough for other researchers to actually find and utilise what you’ve put out there. It’s important to
  know the benefits and issues around where you store and publish your software and data, and to make the most of the
  tools the different platforms provide, such as Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). It’s also important to know good
  practice for how to increase the visibility and citability of your work in cases where your chosen platform lacks
  these features.

The course uses worked examples to introduce and explore elements that you should consider when publishing your
software which will help you easily reference your work and help make it more findable and reusable by others.

## Target audience

This course is aimed at researchers, including postgraduate researchers, who write software (whether a few scripts or
something more substantial) as part of their research and wish to bring open research best practice to their project or
team.

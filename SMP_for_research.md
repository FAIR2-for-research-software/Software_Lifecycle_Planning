## Introduction


## A traditional Software Management Plan (SMP)


## The version adapted for research

Research is quite different from private sector. The goal of a research software is to answer a research question in a way that allows other people (and yourself) to carry it forward. ALigning the SMP to the research lifecyle ensure that the software not only facilitates scientific progress but also meets academics standards for collaboration, documentation and reproducibility.

Note: Not covered here is the finance part of the plan.. 


### Project Overview

This is the start of the project. You will not start a research software without having a research question you want to answer. Having a clear research question will greatly help you define your software. 

Then what would you do? The answer is the same as for the research question: you look at what is already out there in the literature. If someone already answered your research question then you would not try to answer it again. So if you want to build a software you will first look at what is already available. **DO NOT RE-INVENT THE WHEEL**. 
If something similar exists then don't recode it! If something is already available but does not have all the functionality you are looking for then maybe you can build upon that previous work. If the code is open source, you might just be able to clone it and carry it forward. If it is not, you might be able to contact the P.I. and ask if you can have access to the source code (you might create new collaborations!). If you still want to create something from scratch while something already exist, always ask yourself: what would make people use my solution?

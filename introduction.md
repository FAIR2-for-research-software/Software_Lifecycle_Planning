## What is a software and how is it developed?

### Definition

It is not always easy to define what constitutes a software in research. The size of projects can vary from a small script of a few dozens of lines to a massive project with millions of lines. If you are interested in a discussion around a research software definition you can have a look [here](https://zenodo.org/records/5504016). For the shortcut version here is a definition of research software that we are going to consider:

:::::::::::: callout

Research Software includes source code files, algorithms,scripts,computational workflows and executables that were created during the research process or for a research purpose. Software components (e.g., operating systems, libraries, dependencies, packages, scripts,etc.) that are used for research but were not created during or with a clear research intent should be considered software in research and not Research Software. This differentiatio nmay vary between disciplines.

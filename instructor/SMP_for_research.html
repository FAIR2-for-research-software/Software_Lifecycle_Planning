<section><h2 class="section-heading" id="introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introduction"></a></h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>A Software Management Plan (SMP) is a framework that outlines how
software development, releases, maintenance, and support will be
conducted throughout its lifecycle. It outlines how the key aspects like
goals, resources, milestones, risks, and quality are effectively
controlled. The plan is usually created early in the project, ideally
before work is undertaken, and is essential for both small and large
projects to ensure clear communication and expectations among team
members.</p>
<p>This chapter presents various point that you should think about when
you start developing code for research. The goal is that you ask
yourself the right questions before embarking on your software
development journey.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="software-management-plan">Software Management Plan<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#software-management-plan"></a></h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>Research is quite different from the private sector. The goal of a
research software is to answer a research question in a way that allows
other people (and yourself) to carry it forward. Aligning the SMP to the
research lifecycle ensures that the software not only facilitates
scientific progress but also meets academics standards for
collaboration, documentation and reproducibility.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="project-overview">Project Overview<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#project-overview"></a></h3>
<p>You will not start a research software project without having a
research question you want to answer. Instead of business requirement
that you would have in a traditional software lifecycle you should
therefore gather research objectives. Having a clear research question
will greatly help you define the requirements for your software.</p>
<p>But how do you proceed? The answer is the same as for the research
question: you look at what is already out there in the literature and
software ecosystem of your domain. If someone has already answered your
research question then you typically would not try to answer it again
(unless seeking to replicate the finding). The same is true for research
software: you will first look at what is already available. The case
where people are re-implementing something that already exist is far too
common and wastes a lot of previous research time and funding. In short:
<strong>DO NOT RE-INVENT THE WHEEL</strong>. If something is already
available but does not have all the functionalities you are looking for
then maybe you can build upon that previous work. If the code is open
source, you might just be able to clone it and carry it forward (as long
as you give credit to the original author). Alternatively you may be
able to contribute features up-stream to the package you wish to use at
the same time forging connections and potential collaborations. If it is
not open source, you might be able to contact the author and ask if you
can have access to the source code, again this may lead to fruitful
collaborations!</p>
<p>If you still want to create something from scratch when something
already exists, always ask yourself: what would make people use my
solution instead of the one that is already available? What benefits
will my software bring to the research community?</p>
<p>When you have a good sense of what you want to create you must define
what data will be used as input and what the output of the software will
look like. It is common that for a given domain some data standard are
already in use. Try to stick to these standards as much as you can as
doing so will make your software more <strong>Interoperable</strong>
with other systems and <strong>Reusable</strong> by others.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="human-and-technical-resources">Human and Technical resources<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#human-and-technical-resources"></a></h3>
<p>Once you have a good idea of what you want to create, the next step
is to identify who is in charge of it. Identify team members (e.g. P.I,
Research Software Engineers (RSE), Postdocs, PhD students) and define
their roles in the development of the tool. It is often useful to extend
the distribution of roles to other aspects of the project, such as data
management &amp; publication (it is important that everybody gets credit
for their work and <strong>can evidence it</strong>). Doing this before
you start you will help you identify what skills are available in your
team and what, if any, deficiencies there are and hence identifying the
needs for training. Discussing these aspects beforehand will save you
time and potentially help avoid some painful discussions (and
frustrations) down the line.</p>
<p>One crucial aspect of a software project, especially occurring in
research, is the problem of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor" class="external-link">bus factor</a>. Simply
put it is a measurement of risk that arises if a member of the team were
“<em>hit by a bus</em>” and the information and capabilities they hold
about the project has not been shared with the team. The worst bus
factor is 1 and means a single person is in charge of everything. If you
lose that person then the project stops as no one else knows about the
project or has the skills to continue working on it. The higher the bus
number the better as it means there is shared knowledge and skills
within the team. However, trying to mitigate this bus factor is crucial,
and sometimes very hard to do, particularly in smaller research groups.
There are some steps that can be taken though, for example you might
want to have different people within the team familiar with the code.
This can be achieved through regular peer review during the development
cycle. Perhaps most important is to have very clear and up-to-date
documentation on what the software does and how it is used. The module
on <a href="https://joe-heffer-shef.github.io/FAIR4RS-Documentation/" class="external-link">Documentation</a>
will be helpful in how to go about this.</p>
<p>On the technical side, it is important to identify technical
resources, e.g. computing environment, High Performance Computing
platform, that might be available. You might not see their need at
first, but as development proceeds if you know what support you can get
from your own institution it will be useful know where and how
accessible the support is as some, such as Research Software Engineer
support, may need financing and you would need to plan this in advance
as part of the budget.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="development-approach">Development Approach<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#development-approach"></a></h3>
<p>How will you develop your code? Multiple ways exist to manage the
development of a software, we can name two here:</p>
<ul><li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_model" class="external-link">Waterfall</a>: This
approach is a linear and sequential project management technique where
each phase depends on the completion of the previous one. It consists of
stages like requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing,
deployment, and maintenance. Progress flows in one direction, similar to
a waterfall. Changes are difficult to implement once a phase is
completed. It is best suited for projects with well-defined requirements
and minimal expected changes.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development" class="external-link">Agile</a>:
This approach is an iterative and flexible project management technique
focused on delivering small, incremental improvements. It encourages
collaboration between cross-functional teams, frequent feedback, and
continuous adaptation to changes. Work is divided into short cycles
called sprints, with regular reviews to assess progress. Agile
prioritizes customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery.
It is best suited for dynamic projects with evolving
requirements.</p></li>
</ul><p>Whatever method of project management you choose, ensure that it is
fostering collaboration within the group. Both have their advantages but
keep in mind that research is an iterative provess involving a lot of
trial-and-error cycles and experimentation. Communication will be a key
aspect of success. It might be interesting to have short development
cycles with an iterative approach in which case an Agile approach would
be more suited. This will help you analyse intermediary research
outcomes, review the development of the software (and documentation) and
overall progress and regularly review and realign the goals if
necessary. It is not rare that while developing a research tool with a
clear goal in mind you end up finding serendipitous results that are
worthy of publication in their own right!</p>
<p>The tools are you use for software development are also very
important. Do not end up with multiple files for the multiple version of
your software (e.g. version1, version 1_1, version1_2, version1_final,
version1_final2, etc.). It will become unmanageable. To avoid this
situation, it is important to have a version control tool that allows
you to track the changes that you implement in your software over time.
Using version control will help making your software more
<strong>FAIR</strong>. If you are unfamiliar with version control then
the modules on <a href="https://srse-git-github-zero2hero.netlify.app/" class="external-link">Git for
Beginners</a> and <a href="https://blog.nshephard.dev/git-collaboration/" class="external-link">Git
Collaboration</a> will be useful.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="timeline-and-milestones">Timeline and Milestones<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#timeline-and-milestones"></a></h3>
<p>Creating software is not easy. The bigger it gets, the more
complicated it becomes. Hence it is important to have checkpoints, or
milestones, that you can work toward. It is often possible to split the
development of a software package into multiple intermediary states.
These intermediary states will give you more realistic and achievable
objectives and allow you to track progress and allow you to create your
development timeline.</p>
<p>It is important to coordinate this timeline with research milestones
and deadlines. They can be paper submissions, conference presentations,
funding deadlines, PhD thesis submissions. Software development and
research progress should be as aligned as possible and tracked
concurrently. If they diverge you will be in trouble.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="risk-management">Risk Management<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#risk-management"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Spoiler alert: nothing will work from the first try!</strong>
You will inevitably encounter blockers which hinder progress during the
development of your software and only some of these will be identifiable
beforehand. Failure to achieve scientific outcomes, data issues
(sometimes data will never arrive!), reproducibility failures, or
tool/library obsolescence are examples of risks that can be
anticipated.</p>
<p>Once identified, you should think about how to mitigate these risks
and create a contingency plan (a plan B) in case they turn out to be
real problems (e.g. backup strategies for data and code, alternative
methods).</p>
<p>One important aspect of research it is that it is hard to plan. So
how you address changes in the research hypothesis, data, or
experimental design and how this might impact software development is
important to consider. Ensure proper version control for both code and
datasets and allow for flexibility for exploratory research where new
insights might lead to changes in the software. This gets much easier
when the code is written in a maintainable, readable and
<strong>Reusable</strong> way. If unfamiliar with software development
the module on <a href="https://romain-thomas-shef.github.io/FAIR_Code_design/" class="external-link">Design
your code</a> will be useful.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="quality-assurance">Quality Assurance<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#quality-assurance"></a></h3>
<p>Wouldn’t it be sad if all the work you have been putting in your
software development is wasted by a typo in the code? How do you make
sure that the code you are writing is functioning as intended and that
the scientific results your producing are reliable and reproducible?</p>
<p>There are some strategies to ensure both code quality and research
reproducibility:</p>
<ul><li><p><strong>Peer Review</strong> : Code quality can be checked by
doing code peer reviews. Regular peer review are very helpful both for
increasing the quality and for disseminating knowledge in the team
(reducing the bus factor). Automated testing with continuous
integration. There are modules on <a href="https://sylviawhittle.github.io/python-testing-for-research/" class="external-link">testing
and continuous integration</a> and version control (<a href="https://srse-git-github-zero2hero.netlify.app/" class="external-link">Git for
Beginners</a> and <a href="https://blog.nshephard.dev/git-collaboration/" class="external-link">Git
Collaboration</a>) that can be undertaken.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Version Control</strong> : Reproducibility will
benefit from the previous suggestions, but you can also adopt a strategy
for data version control (DVC) that will help track the state of your
data and changes. Parametrisation of code ensures that it can be rerun
with different parameters easily (without changing the code) via
configuration files or command line interface. The module on <a href="https://romain-thomas-shef.github.io/FAIR_Code_design/" class="external-link">Code
Design</a> covers how to do this.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>User Testing</strong> : Testing by other people also
helps. If someone else in your team can reproduce your results it will
give you a good idea of how reproducible are your results. For a more
advanced case, it is possible to fully automatise reproducibility checks
and strategies for this are covered in the <a href="https://sylviawhittle.github.io/python-testing-for-research/" class="external-link">testing
and continuous integration</a> module.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reliability</strong> : The reliability of scientific
output can be tested by comparing your code with existing datasets. Can
you replicate existing results with your own tool? That will give you an
interesting insight.</p></li>
</ul><p>Tested software is more reliable and robust and thorough testing of
your code will greatly enhance its <strong>Re-usability</strong> and
make your science more <strong>Reproducible</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="dissemination">Dissemination<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#dissemination"></a></h3>
<p>Dissemination is a cornerstone of research. When it comes to research
software you will have to make sure that people know where to find it
and how to use it (<strong>Findable</strong> and
<strong>Reusable</strong>). It comes down to three important
pillars:</p>
<ul><li><p><strong>License</strong>: This is probably one of the most basic
items of the software management plan. If there is no license for your
software people won’t know if they have the right to reuse your
software. No license means that you retain all the rights to your source
code and no one may reproduce, distribute or create derivative works
from your code (which is the opposite of research philosophy). Please
see the chapter on intellectual property and software licenses for more
details <strong>[link TBD]</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Documentation</strong> is paramount, the main group that
will help is your future self and members of your team! Research
projects often span several years during which new members will join and
some will leave the team. If it takes someone 6 months just to
understand the software that the team is developing that is wasted time.
If you want a sustainable project, write good documentation. In
addition, If you produce software with a good documentation it will be
more likely used by the community and then you might get credit for it!
Make sure that the documentation is easily accessible (e.g. a website)
and tailored to future researchers and the academic community in your
research domain. You should describe the research question the software
seeks to solve as well as how the software works and should be used. The
module on <a href="https://joe-heffer-shef.github.io/FAIR4RS-Documentation/" class="external-link">Documentation</a>
covers advice on how to document software projects.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Software Repositories</strong>: It is important to place
your software (the released version) to a place where people can
download it freely. Collaborative development platform such as <a href="https://github.com/" class="external-link">Github</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/" class="external-link">GitLab</a> are not made to store software on
the long term. More persistent platforms designed for the sharing of
research output exist such as <a href="https://figshare.com/" class="external-link">Figshare</a> and <a href="https://zeondo.org" class="external-link">Zenodo</a> and should be used for long term
storage of software. Please see chapter on dissemination for more
details <strong>[Link TBD]</strong>.</p></li>
</ul><p>To go a little bit further, you might want to take extra step in the
dissemination direction:</p>
<ul><li><p><strong>Publication</strong>: Once you release your software, you
might want to publish it! Numerous journals accept papera about research
software. Some are generalists (e.g. <a href="https://joss.theoj.org/" class="external-link">JOSS</a>, JORS, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/softwarex" class="external-link">SoftwareX</a> to
name a few) and some are domain oriented (you can get a non-exhaustive
list from the <a href="https://www.software.ac.uk/top-tip/which-journals-should-i-publish-my-software" class="external-link">Software
Sustainability Institute</a>)). A dedicated paper describing your
software is really something you should consider! It will give you a lot
of visibility and allow you to get a citable paper associated to your
software (you can follow the lecture on [Publishing your software] for
this).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Training</strong>: If your software sees a lot of buy-in
from the community and is relatively complex to use (not all software
is), you might want to train others to use it. You can do that via
tutorials and/or training events. This is a very powerful way to give
your work more visibility and a very efficient way to create
collaborations!</p></li>
</ul></div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="long-term-sustainability">Long term sustainability<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#long-term-sustainability"></a></h3>
<p>Maintenance of the software is tricky. There are two possible
scenarios:</p>
<ul><li><p>The software is in a final form, but the funding is still there:
In that case it is important to identify who is in charge of the
maintenance and update. You might be working with totally different
people than at the beginning of the project. So it is important to plan
ahead for this in the Software Management Plan.</p></li>
<li><p>The research project comes to an end (and with it, its founding).
That’s the tricky situation, long term maintenance is difficult because
funders do not plan for this (which happens everywhere). If you want to
increase the chances that your software works in 5 or 10 years, what you
could envisage to do is to distribute your software with its own
computational environment. This ships your software with the required
dependencies and put all this in its own bubble. This greatly enhances
the long term <strong>Reproducibility</strong> of your work. If you are
interested to learn more about this, you can enrol in the <a href="https://ubdbra001.github.io/FAIR4RS-VirtualEnvs/" class="external-link">Reproducible
Computational Environment</a>.</p></li>
</ul><p>In either scenario having accessible and detailed documentation will
be really useful for the long term maintenance of the code.</p>
</div>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="minimal-version">Minimal version<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#minimal-version"></a></h2>
<hr class="half-width"><p>Everything that has been described previously can be quite
intimidating at first. There is a lot to think about and depending on
the size of your project you might not need all of these details. If you
want to go with a minimal set of items to put in place you could use the
following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Information on what software outputs (including documentation and
other related material) are expected to be produced.</li>
<li>Who is responsible for the development work?;</li>
<li>Which version control system is to be used?</li>
<li>What license will be used for each produced piece of code/data?</li>
</ol><p>These four items should be on your list in the planning phase.</p>

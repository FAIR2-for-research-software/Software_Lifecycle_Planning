<hr class="half-width">
<p>A Software management plan [SMP] is a framework that outlines how
software development, releases, maintenance, and support will be
conducted throughout its lifecycle. It outlines how the key aspects like
goals, ressources, milestone, risks, and quality are effectively
controlled. The plan is usually created early in the project and is
essential for both small and large projects to ensure clear
communication and expectations among team members and stakeholders. In
this chapter we present various point that you might want to think about
when you start developing a code for research. The goal is that you ask
yourself the right questions before embarking in an important software
development journey.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Research is quite different from private sector. The goal of a
research software is to answer a research question in a way that allows
other people (and yourself) to carry it forward. Aligning the SMP to the
research lifecyle ensure that the software not only facilitates
scientific progress but also meets academics standards for
collaboration, documentation and reproducibility.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="project-overview">Project Overview<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#project-overview"></a>
</h3>
<p>This is the start of the project. You will not start a research
software without having a research question you want to answer. Having a
clear research question will greatly help you define your software.</p>
<p>Then what would you do? The answer is the same as for the research
question: you look at what is already out there in the literature. If
someone had already answered your research question then you would not
try to answer it again. So if you want to build a software you will
first look at what is already available. <strong>DO NOT RE-INVENT THE
WHEEL</strong>.</p>
<p>If something similar exists then don’t recode it! If something is
already available but does not have all the functionalities you are
looking for then maybe you can build upon that previous work. If the
code is open source, you might just be able to clone it and carry it
forward. If it is not, you might be able to contact the P.I. and ask if
you can have access to the source code (you might create new
collaborations!).</p>
<p>If you still want to create something from scratch while something
already exists, always ask yourself: what would make people use my
solution intead of the one that is already available? What addition does
my software bring to the research community?</p>
<p>Finally, what do you expect to produce? What is the end product? What
output will it create? How will I make people engage with it? All these
questions are important!</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="human-and-technical-ressouces">Human and Technical ressouces<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#human-and-technical-ressouces"></a>
</h3>
<p>Once you have a good idea of what you want to create, the next step
is to identify who is in charge of it. Identify team members (P.I, RSE,
Postdocs, PhD students) and their roles in the development of the tool.
It is often useful to extend these distribution of roles to other
aspects of the project, such as data management &amp; publication (it is
important that everybody gets credit for their work and <strong>can
evidence it</strong>). Doing this before you start you will identify
what are the skills available in your team and what are the missing
ones, hence identifying the needs for training. Discussing these aspects
beforehand will make you save time and potentialy avoid some painful
discussions (and frustrations) down the line.<br>
One crucial aspect of a software project, especially occuring in
research, is the problem of the bus factor. Simply put the bus factor is
a number equal to the amount of people in your project that could get it
by a bus without putting your project in trouble. The worst bus factor
is 1 and means a single person is in charge of everything. If you lose
that person that project stops. Trying to mitigate this bus factor is
crucial, and sometimes very hard to do. You might want to have different
people aware of the code(through peer code review in the team), and what
will be very important is to have a very clean and up-to-date
documentation (the lecture on <a href="https://mydevelopment.csod.com/ui/lms-learning-details/app/event/7c81f9fd-656f-4ae9-ba48-bc83afe81cc2" class="external-link">Documentation</a>
might help you do that).</p>
<p>On the technical side, it is important to identify technical
resources, e.g. computing environement, High Performance Computing
platform, that might be available. You might not see their need at
first, but as the development goes on, if you know what support you can
get from your own institution it is always interesting to know where and
how accessible they are (some might need financing that you need to plan
in advance!).</p>

<h3 id="development-approach">Development Approach<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#development-approach"></a>
</h3>
<p>How will you develop your code? Multiple ways exist to manage the
development of a software, we can name two here:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Waterfall: This approach is a linear and sequential project
management technique where each phase depends on the completion of the
previous one. It consists of stages like requirements gathering, design,
implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Progress flows in
one direction, similar to a waterfall. Changes are difficult to
implement once a phase is completed. It is best suited for projects with
well-defined requirements and minimal expected changes.</p></li>
<li><p>Agile: This approach is an iterative and flexible project
management technique focused on delivering small, incremental
improvements. It encourages collaboration between cross-functional
teams, frequent feedback, and continuous adaptation to changes. Work is
divided into short cycles called sprints, with regular reviews to assess
progress. Agile prioritizes customer satisfaction through early and
continuous delivery. It is best suited for dynamic projects with
evolving requirements.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever method of project management you choose, ensure that it is
fostering collaboration within the group. Research is an iterative
provess involving a lot of trials/errors cycle and experimentations.
Communication will be a key aspect of success. It might be interesting
to have short development cycles with an iterative approach. This will
help you analyse intermediary research outcomes, review the development
of the software (and documentation) and overall progress. It is not rare
that while developing a research tool with a clear goal in mind you end
up finding serendipitous results that are worth a publication!</p>
<p>In addition, what tools are you using for software development? Do
not end up with multiple files for the multiple version of your software
(e.g. version1, version 1_1, version1_2, version1_final,
version1_final2, etccc). It will become unmanageable. To avoid such a
situation, it is important to have a version control tool that allows
you to track the changes that you implement in your software. Some
lectures on this program could help with this: <a href="https://mydevelopment.csod.com/ui/lms-learning-details/app/event/d4d09f67-097b-4451-8ddb-86cb90636c06" class="external-link">Git-beginners</a>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="timeline-and-milestones">Timeline and Milestones<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#timeline-and-milestones"></a>
</h3>
<p>Creating a software is not easy. The bigger it gets, the more
complicated it becomes. Hence it is important to have checkpoints, or
milestones, that you can work toward. It is often possible to split the
development of a research into multiple intermediary states. These
intermediary states will give you more realistic and achievable
objectives and allow you to track the work. This will create your
development timeline.</p>
<p>In addition, it is important to coordinate this timeline with
research milestones and deadlines. They can be paper submissions,
conference presentations, funding milestones, PhD thesis milestones.
Software development and research progress should be as aligned as
possible and tracked concurently. If they diverge you will be in
trouble.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="risk-management">Risk Management<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#risk-management"></a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Nothing will work from the first try!</strong> You will find
blockades on the way and some can be identified beforehand. Failure to
achieve scientific outcomes, data issues (sometimes will never come!),
reproducibility failures, or tool/library obsolescence are example of
such risks.</p>
<p>Once identified, you should think how to mitigate these risks and
create a contingency plan (a plan B) in case they turn out to be real
problems (e.g., backup strategies for data and code, alternative
methods).</p>
<p>One important aspect of research it is that it is hard to plan. So
how will you address changes in the research hypothesis, data, or
experimental design and how might that impact the software. Ensure
proper version control for both code and datasets and allow for
flexibility for exploratory research where new insights might lead to
changes in the software. This gets much easier when the code is written
in a maintainable and readable way (The lecture on <a href="https://mydevelopment.csod.com/ui/lms-learning-details/app/event/d3c2cca5-d894-44b6-a79b-e93dea7a7c94" class="external-link">Design
your code</a> might be helpful for this).</p>

<h3 id="quality-assurance">Quality Assurance<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#quality-assurance"></a>
</h3>
<p><em>Wouldn’t it be sad that all the work you have been putting in
your software development is wasted by a typo in the code?</em> How do
you make sure that the code you are writing is doing things as it is
intended to be done? And that the scientific results your producing are
reliable and reproducible?</p>
<p>Develop strategies to ensure both code quality and research
reproducibility: * The code quality can be achieved by doing code peer
reviews. Regular peer review are very helpful both for increasing the
quality and for disseminating knowledge in the team (reducing the bus
factor). Automated testing with continuous integration (cf lecture on
Testing and continuous integration with S. Wittle <strong>[link
TBD]</strong>), version control (cf LectureS on version control by Neil
Shepherd <strong>[link TBD]</strong>), etc… * Research reproducibility
will also benefit from all of the previous suggestions, but you can add
data version control (DVC) that will help track the state of your data
and changes, parametrisation of code ensures that it can be rerun with
different parameters easily (without changing the code) via
configuration files or command line interface <strong>[link
TBD]</strong>. Testing by other people also helps. If someone else in
your team can reproduce your results gives a good idea of how
reproducible are your results. Finally, and for a more advanced case, it
is possible to fully automatise reproducibility checks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reliability of science results can be tested by comparing your code
with exsiting datasets. Can you replicate exiting results with your own
tool? That will give you an interesting insight.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="dissemination-">Dissemination.<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#dissemination-"></a>
</h3>
<p>Dissemination is a cornerstone of research. When it comes to research
software you will have to make sure that people know where to find it
and how to use it. It comes down to three important pilars:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>License: This is probably one of the most basic item of the
software management plan. If there is no license in your software people
won’t know if they have the right to re-use your software. No license
means that you retain all the rights to your source code and no one may
reproduce, distribute or create derivative works from your code (which
is the opposite of research philosophy). Please see the chapter on
intellectual property and software licenses for more details
<strong>[link TBD]</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Documentation is paramount: And guess what, the main group that
it will help is YOUR TEAM! Research projects often span several years
with people coming in and some leaving the team. If it takes someone 6
months just to understand the software that the team is developing it is
going to be a waste of time. If you want a sustainable project, write a
good documentation. In addition, If you produce a software with a good
documentation it will be more likely used by the community and then you
might get credit for it! You should make sure that the documentation is
easily accessible (e.g. a website) and tailored to future researchers
and the academic community in your research domain (cf Documentation
module with Joe Heffer <strong>[link TBD]</strong>). Document how the
software works, but not only this. Always describe how it serves a
research question.</p></li>
<li><p>Software repositories: It is important to place your software
(the released version) to a place where people can download it freely.
Collaborative development platform such as github are not made to store
software on the long term. Nevertheless, other platform are made for
this (e.g. figshare, zenodo, etc..). This is where you should look for a
long term storage. Please see chapter on dissemination for more details
<strong>[Link TBD]</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To go a little bit further, you might want to take extra step in the
dissemination direction:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Publication: Once you release your software, you might want to
publish it! Numerous journals accept papera about research software.
Some are generalists (e.g. JOSS, JORS, SoftwareX, etc <strong>[add
links]</strong>) and some are domain oriented <strong>[add link
TBD]</strong>. This is really something you should consider! It will
give you a lot of visibility and allow you to get a citable paper
associated to your software [<strong>link to JOSS
lecture</strong>].</p></li>
<li><p>Training: If your software sees a lot of buy-in in the community
and that is relatively complex to use (not all software are), you might
want to train others to use it. You can do that via tutorials or
training events. This is a very powerful way to give your work more
visibility and a very efficient way to create collaborations!</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="long-term-sustainability">Long term sustainability<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#long-term-sustainability"></a>
</h3>
<p>Maintenance of the software is tricky. We can distinguish two parts:
- The software is in a final form, but the founding is still there: In
that case it is important to identify who is in charge of the
maintenance and update. You might work with totally different people
than at the beginning of the project. So it is important to plan this
ahead (cf previous section). A good documentation will always help the
maintenance. - The research project comes to an end (and with it, its
founding). That’s the tricky situation, long term maintenance is
difficult because founders do not plan for this (which happens
everywhere). If you want to increase the chance that your software work
in 5 or 10 years, what you could envisage to do is to distribute your
software with its own computational environment. This ships your
software with the required dependencies and put all this in its
own bubble.  If you are interested to learn more about this, register to
the lecture on reproducible Computational environment, by Daniel Brady
<strong>[Link TBD]</strong>.</p>
<p>In general, making a software open-source, will increase the chance
that other people can increase its lifetime beyond your own involvement!
(Cf section on Software Licence)</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Everything that has been described previously can be quite
intimidating at first. There is a lot to think about and depending on
the size of your project you might not need all of these details. If you
want to go with a minimal set of items to put in place you could choose
the following ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information on what software outputs (including documentation and
other related material) are expected to be produced ;</li>
<li>Who is responsible for the development work?;</li>
<li>The version control process to be used;</li>
<li>What license will be used for each output?</li>
</ul>
<p>These four items should be mandatory for each software created in
academia.</p>

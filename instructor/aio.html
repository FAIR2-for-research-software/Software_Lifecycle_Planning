<hr class="half-width">
<p>A Software Management Plan (SMP) is a framework that outlines how
software development, releases, maintenance, and support will be
conducted throughout its lifecycle. It outlines how the key aspects like
goals, resources, milestones, risks, and quality are effectively
controlled. The plan is usually created early in the project, ideally
before work is undertaken, and is essential for both small and large
projects to ensure clear communication and expectations among team
members.</p>
<p>This chapter presents various point that you should think about when
you start developing code for research. The goal is that you ask
yourself the right questions before embarking on your software
development journey.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="software-management-plan">Software Management Plan<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#software-management-plan"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Research is quite different from the private sector. The goal of a
research software is to answer a research question in a way that allows
other people (and yourself) to carry it forward. Aligning the SMP to the
research lifecycle ensures that the software not only facilitates
scientific progress but also meets academics standards for
collaboration, documentation and reproducibility.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="project-overview">Project Overview<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#project-overview"></a>
</h3>
<p>You will not start a research software project without having a
research question you want to answer. Instead of business requirement
that you would have in a traditional software lifecycle you should
therefore gather research objectives. Having a clear research question
will greatly help you define the requirements for your software.</p>
<p>But how do you proceed? The answer is the same as for the research
question: you look at what is already out there in the literature and
software ecosystem of your domain. If someone has already answered your
research question then you typically would not try to answer it again
(unless seeking to replicate the finding). The same is true for research
software: you will first look at what is already available. The case
where people are re-implementing something that already exist is far too
common and wastes a lot of previous research time and funding. In short:
<strong>DO NOT RE-INVENT THE WHEEL</strong>. If something is already
available but does not have all the functionalities you are looking for
then maybe you can build upon that previous work. If the code is open
source, you might just be able to clone it and carry it forward (as long
as you give credit to the original author). Alternatively you may be
able to contribute features up-stream to the package you wish to use at
the same time forging connections and potential collaborations. If it is
not open source, you might be able to contact the author and ask if you
can have access to the source code, again this may lead to fruitful
collaborations!</p>
<p>If you still want to create something from scratch when something
already exists, always ask yourself: what would make people use my
solution instead of the one that is already available? What benefits
will my software bring to the research community?</p>
<p>When you have a good sense of what you want to create you must define
what data will be used as input and what the output of the software will
look like. It is common that for a given domain some data standard are
already in use. Try to stick to these standards as much as you can as
doing so will make your software more <strong>Interoperable</strong>
with other systems and <strong>Reusable</strong> by others.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="human-and-technical-resources">Human and Technical resources<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#human-and-technical-resources"></a>
</h3>
<p>Once you have a good idea of what you want to create, the next step
is to identify who is in charge of it. Identify team members (e.g. P.I,
Research Software Engineers (RSE), Postdocs, PhD students) and define
their roles in the development of the tool. It is often useful to extend
the distribution of roles to other aspects of the project, such as data
management &amp; publication (it is important that everybody gets credit
for their work and <strong>can evidence it</strong>). Doing this before
you start you will help you identify what skills are available in your
team and what, if any, deficiencies there are and hence identifying the
needs for training. Discussing these aspects beforehand will save you
time and potentially help avoid some painful discussions (and
frustrations) down the line.</p>
<p>One crucial aspect of a software project, especially occurring in
research, is the problem of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor" class="external-link">bus factor</a>. Simply
put it is a measurement of risk that arises if a member of the team were
“<em>hit by a bus</em>” and the information and capabilities they hold
about the project has not been shared with the team. The worst bus
factor is 1 and means a single person is in charge of everything. If you
lose that person then the project stops as no one else knows about the
project or has the skills to continue working on it. The higher the bus
number the better as it means there is shared knowledge and skills
within the team. However, trying to mitigate this bus factor is crucial,
and sometimes very hard to do, particularly in smaller research groups.
There are some steps that can be taken though, for example you might
want to have different people within the team familiar with the code.
This can be achieved through regular peer review during the development
cycle. Perhaps most important is to have very clear and up-to-date
documentation on what the software does and how it is used. The module
on <a href="https://joe-heffer-shef.github.io/FAIR4RS-Documentation/" class="external-link">Documentation</a>
will be helpful in how to go about this.</p>
<p>On the technical side, it is important to identify technical
resources, e.g. computing environment, High Performance Computing
platform, that might be available. You might not see their need at
first, but as development proceeds if you know what support you can get
from your own institution it will be useful know where and how
accessible the support is as some, such as Research Software Engineer
support, may need financing and you would need to plan this in advance
as part of the budget.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="development-approach">Development Approach<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#development-approach"></a>
</h3>
<p>How will you develop your code? Multiple ways exist to manage the
development of a software, we can name two here:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model" class="external-link">Waterfall</a>: This
approach is a linear and sequential project management technique where
each phase depends on the completion of the previous one. It consists of
stages like requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing,
deployment, and maintenance. Progress flows in one direction, similar to
a waterfall. Changes are difficult to implement once a phase is
completed. It is best suited for projects with well-defined requirements
and minimal expected changes.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development" class="external-link">Agile</a>:
This approach is an iterative and flexible project management technique
focused on delivering small, incremental improvements. It encourages
collaboration between cross-functional teams, frequent feedback, and
continuous adaptation to changes. Work is divided into short cycles
called sprints, with regular reviews to assess progress. Agile
prioritizes customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery.
It is best suited for dynamic projects with evolving
requirements.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever method of project management you choose, ensure that it is
fostering collaboration within the group. Both have their advantages but
keep in mind that research is an iterative provess involving a lot of
trial-and-error cycles and experimentation. Communication will be a key
aspect of success. It might be interesting to have short development
cycles with an iterative approach in which case an Agile approach would
be more suited. This will help you analyse intermediary research
outcomes, review the development of the software (and documentation) and
overall progress and regularly review and realign the goals if
necessary. It is not rare that while developing a research tool with a
clear goal in mind you end up finding serendipitous results that are
worthy of publication in their own right!</p>
<p>The tools are you use for software development are also very
important. Do not end up with multiple files for the multiple version of
your software (e.g. version1, version 1_1, version1_2, version1_final,
version1_final2, etc.). It will become unmanageable. To avoid this
situation, it is important to have a version control tool that allows
you to track the changes that you implement in your software over time.
Using version control will help making your software more
<strong>FAIR</strong>. If you are unfamiliar with version control then
the modules on <a href="https://srse-git-github-zero2hero.netlify.app/" class="external-link">Git for
Beginners</a> and <a href="https://blog.nshephard.dev/git-collaboration/" class="external-link">Git
Collaboration</a> will be useful.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="timeline-and-milestones">Timeline and Milestones<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#timeline-and-milestones"></a>
</h3>
<p>Creating software is not easy. The bigger it gets, the more
complicated it becomes. Hence it is important to have checkpoints, or
milestones, that you can work toward. It is often possible to split the
development of a software package into multiple intermediary states.
These intermediary states will give you more realistic and achievable
objectives and allow you to track progress and allow you to create your
development timeline.</p>
<p>It is important to coordinate this timeline with research milestones
and deadlines. They can be paper submissions, conference presentations,
funding deadlines, PhD thesis submissions. Software development and
research progress should be as aligned as possible and tracked
concurrently. If they diverge you will be in trouble.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="risk-management">Risk Management<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#risk-management"></a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Spoiler alert: nothing will work from the first try!</strong>
You will inevitably encounter blockers which hinder progress during the
development of your software and only some of these will be identifiable
beforehand. Failure to achieve scientific outcomes, data issues
(sometimes data will never arrive!), reproducibility failures, or
tool/library obsolescence are examples of risks that can be
anticipated.</p>
<p>Once identified, you should think about how to mitigate these risks
and create a contingency plan (a plan B) in case they turn out to be
real problems (e.g. backup strategies for data and code, alternative
methods).</p>
<p>One important aspect of research it is that it is hard to plan. So
how you address changes in the research hypothesis, data, or
experimental design and how this might impact software development is
important to consider. Ensure proper version control for both code and
datasets and allow for flexibility for exploratory research where new
insights might lead to changes in the software. This gets much easier
when the code is written in a maintainable, readable and
<strong>Reusable</strong> way. If unfamiliar with software development
the module on <a href="https://romain-thomas-shef.github.io/FAIR_Code_design/" class="external-link">Design
your code</a> will be useful.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="quality-assurance">Quality Assurance<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#quality-assurance"></a>
</h3>
<p>Wouldn’t it be sad if all the work you have been putting in your
software development is wasted by a typo in the code? How do you make
sure that the code you are writing is functioning as intended and that
the scientific results your producing are reliable and reproducible?</p>
<p>There are some strategies to ensure both code quality and research
reproducibility:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Peer Review</strong> : Code quality can be checked by
doing code peer reviews. Regular peer review are very helpful both for
increasing the quality and for disseminating knowledge in the team
(reducing the bus factor). Automated testing with continuous
integration. There are modules on <a href="https://sylviawhittle.github.io/python-testing-for-research/" class="external-link">testing
and continuous integration</a> and version control (<a href="https://srse-git-github-zero2hero.netlify.app/" class="external-link">Git for
Beginners</a> and <a href="https://blog.nshephard.dev/git-collaboration/" class="external-link">Git
Collaboration</a>) that can be undertaken.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Version Control</strong> : Reproducibility will
benefit from the previous suggestions, but you can also adopt a strategy
for data version control (DVC) that will help track the state of your
data and changes. Parametrisation of code ensures that it can be rerun
with different parameters easily (without changing the code) via
configuration files or command line interface. The module on <a href="https://romain-thomas-shef.github.io/FAIR_Code_design/" class="external-link">Code
Design</a> covers how to do this.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>User Testing</strong> : Testing by other people also
helps. If someone else in your team can reproduce your results it will
give you a good idea of how reproducible are your results. For a more
advanced case, it is possible to fully automatise reproducibility checks
and strategies for this are covered in the <a href="https://sylviawhittle.github.io/python-testing-for-research/" class="external-link">testing
and continuous integration</a> module.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reliability</strong> : The reliability of scientific
output can be tested by comparing your code with existing datasets. Can
you replicate existing results with your own tool? That will give you an
interesting insight.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Tested software is more reliable and robust and thorough testing of
your code will greatly enhance its <strong>Re-usability</strong> and
make your science more <strong>Reproducible</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="dissemination">Dissemination<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#dissemination"></a>
</h3>
<p>Dissemination is a cornerstone of research. When it comes to research
software you will have to make sure that people know where to find it
and how to use it (<strong>Findable</strong> and
<strong>Reusable</strong>). It comes down to three important
pillars:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>License</strong>: This is probably one of the most basic
items of the software management plan. If there is no license for your
software people won’t know if they have the right to reuse your
software. No license means that you retain all the rights to your source
code and no one may reproduce, distribute or create derivative works
from your code (which is the opposite of research philosophy). Please
see the chapter on intellectual property and software licenses for more
details <strong>[link TBD]</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Documentation</strong> is paramount, the main group that
will help is your future self and members of your team! Research
projects often span several years during which new members will join and
some will leave the team. If it takes someone 6 months just to
understand the software that the team is developing that is wasted time.
If you want a sustainable project, write good documentation. In
addition, If you produce software with a good documentation it will be
more likely used by the community and then you might get credit for it!
Make sure that the documentation is easily accessible (e.g. a website)
and tailored to future researchers and the academic community in your
research domain. You should describe the research question the software
seeks to solve as well as how the software works and should be used. The
module on <a href="https://joe-heffer-shef.github.io/FAIR4RS-Documentation/" class="external-link">Documentation</a>
covers advice on how to document software projects.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Software Repositories</strong>: It is important to place
your software (the released version) to a place where people can
download it freely. Collaborative development platform such as <a href="https://github.com/" class="external-link">Github</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/" class="external-link">GitLab</a> are not made to store software on
the long term. More persistent platforms designed for the sharing of
research output exist such as <a href="https://figshare.com/" class="external-link">Figshare</a> and <a href="https://zenodo.org" class="external-link">Zenodo</a> and should be used for long term
storage of software. Please see chapter on dissemination for more
details <strong>[Link TBD]</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To go a little bit further, you might want to take extra step in the
dissemination direction:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Publication</strong>: Once you release your software, you
might want to publish it! Numerous journals accept papera about research
software. Some are generalists (e.g. <a href="https://joss.theoj.org/" class="external-link">JOSS</a>, JORS, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/softwarex" class="external-link">SoftwareX</a> to
name a few) and some are domain oriented (you can get a non-exhaustive
list from the <a href="https://www.software.ac.uk/top-tip/which-journals-should-i-publish-my-software" class="external-link">Software
Sustainability Institute</a>)). A dedicated paper describing your
software is really something you should consider! It will give you a lot
of visibility and allow you to get a citable paper associated to your
software (you can follow the lecture on [Publishing your software] for
this).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Training</strong>: If your software sees a lot of buy-in
from the community and is relatively complex to use (not all software
is), you might want to train others to use it. You can do that via
tutorials and/or training events. This is a very powerful way to give
your work more visibility and a very efficient way to create
collaborations!</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="long-term-sustainability">Long term sustainability<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#long-term-sustainability"></a>
</h3>
<p>Maintenance of the software is tricky. There are two possible
scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The software is in a final form, but the funding is still there:
In that case it is important to identify who is in charge of the
maintenance and update. You might be working with totally different
people than at the beginning of the project. So it is important to plan
ahead for this in the Software Management Plan.</p></li>
<li><p>The research project comes to an end (and with it, its founding).
That’s the tricky situation, long term maintenance is difficult because
funders do not plan for this (which happens everywhere). If you want to
increase the chances that your software works in 5 or 10 years, what you
could envisage to do is to distribute your software with its own
computational environment. This ships your software with the required
dependencies and put all this in its own bubble. This greatly enhances
the long term <strong>Reproducibility</strong> of your work. If you are
interested to learn more about this, you can enrol in the <a href="https://ubdbra001.github.io/FAIR4RS-VirtualEnvs/" class="external-link">Reproducible
Computational Environment</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In either scenario having accessible and detailed documentation will
be really useful for the long term maintenance of the code.</p>

<p>Everything that has been described previously can be quite
intimidating at first. There is a lot to think about and depending on
the size of your project you might not need all of these details. If you
want to go with a minimal set of items to put in place you could use the
following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Information on what software outputs (including documentation and
other related material) are expected to be produced.</li>
<li>Who is responsible for the development work?;</li>
<li>Which version control system is to be used?</li>

<p>These four items should be on your list in the planning phase.</p>

</h2>
<p>The code that you write is important. No matter the size, style, or
language, it is an integral aspect of the research that it is part of,
or indeed, sometimes it is the main output of the research project.</p>
<p>Historically ‘research outputs’ have been focused on papers, and
while this is still mostly true, there has been a change in recent years
to give better acknowledgement to other research outputs, such as code.
There has also been a shift (which we are continuing to see) that
funders are requiring other outputs from projects to be made available.
While this is mostly focused on the data that has been collected or
used, in certain fields code is also part of this. You may also come
across conferences or awards that require code to be available (and
open) in order to submit or be considered. There’s also been a rich
history of code being made free and available to others.</p>
<p>Regardless of the reason you want to disseminate your code, there are
some ways you can make this easier for both yourself and anyone who
wishes to use your code - these include DOIs, using repositories,
providing metadata, and knowing how to cite yourself.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="what-is-a-doi">What is a DOI?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-is-a-doi"></a>
</h2>
<p>A DOI is a type of PID. A PID is a Persistent Identifier - a
reference that will continue to identify the same object, person or
institution over time. A DOI is a Digital Object Identifier - a PID that
refers specifically to a digital object such as an online article,
dataset or archived piece of software. Each individual DOI is linked to
a specific digital object and (should) always direct to that object,
regardless of potential changes to its location or metadata. The most
common use of DOIs is for journal articles. A single article should have
a single DOI, but they can also be used for databases or
software/code.</p>
<div id="example-doi" class="callout">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="bell"></i>
</div>
<div id="example-doi" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">Example DOI</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>This is what a DOI looks like: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ascom.2020.100427" class="external-link">10.1016/j.ascom.2020.100427</a></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>You’ve probably seen these many times before because, like this one,
they are used for journal articles. Interestingly, the article the above
DOI links to is about a tool that has been created, is freely available,
and has a licence applied to it, but it provides no link to the <a href="https://github.com/astrom-tom/SPARTAN" class="external-link">code/software
itself</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="isnt-that-just-a-linkurl">Isn’t that just a link/URL?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#isnt-that-just-a-linkurl"></a>
</h2>
<p>No. The internet as a whole is much more fragile than most people
think. There area myriad of different ways that things can break or
cease to exist. While there are, of course, some old webpages that are
still up for no apparent reason, and multiple archives and projects that
try to capture parts of the internet (<a href="https://web.archive.org/" class="external-link">Wayback Machine</a>, <a href="https://www.softwareheritage.org/" class="external-link">Software Heritage</a>), these
are by no means complete.</p>
<p>But thinking of your own code, if it’s on a webpage (maybe your own),
hosting isn’t free: are you planning on keeping this webpage for a long
time? Can you guarantee it will never be moved from that page/URL, and
do you know if other people are using that link?</p>
<div id="callout2" class="callout">
<div class="callout-square">

</div>
<div class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">Callout</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>A DOI essentially makes it someone else’s job to ensure that the link
resolves to the right digital object.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Only registered organisations can create DOI’s. To be able to mint a
DOI, an organisation must meet the International DOI Foundations
standards and pay to become a member, meaning that they must have the
ability to ensure the DOIs are maintained.</p>
<p>DOIs are also designed to be short and human-readable, again unlike
most URLs, whereas shortened URLs are not persistent.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="doi-and-version-control">DOI and version control<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#doi-and-version-control"></a>
</h2>
<p>Version control is of course very important around code (see the
Version Control part of the FAIR<sup>2</sup>4RS training), and you
shouldn’t create more than one DOI for a single digital object - however
you can nevertheless version with DOIs:</p>
<div id="dois-with-multiple-versions" class="callout">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="bell"></i>
</div>
<div id="dois-with-multiple-versions" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">DOIs with multiple versions</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.15131/shef.data.22633528.v2" class="external-link">10.15131/shef.data.22633528<strong>.v2</strong></a></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>That part at the end indicates which version the DOI will resolve to.
If you have written some code for a research project, and the current
version is the one that was used, but you are still developing it,
referencing that version in any paper or outputs will allow people to
see exactly what the code looked like at the time the research was
conducted.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that if no version suffix is included in the
DOI link, it will resolve to the most recent version of the object. This
is sometimes exactly what is wanted and sometimes not, so it’s good to
think about this when using a DOI.</p>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="how-do-i-get-a-doi">How do I get a DOI?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#how-do-i-get-a-doi"></a>
</h2>
<p>To get a DOI for code, the best place to use is a repository. It’s
important to note that (currently) GitHub does not mint DOIs. Some
examples of repositories that do are <a href="https://about.zenodo.org" class="external-link">Zenodo</a> and the University’s
institutional repository, <a href="https://orda.shef.ac.uk" class="external-link">ORDA</a>.</p>
<p>When you make a deposit in a repository that does mint DOIs, there
should be nothing extra you have to do, when it has been published,
there will be a DOI that you can use to cite and refer to your work.</p>

<p>Hosting large amounts of data, minting DOIs, creating a usable
interface for code and the ability to pull the code to other work setups
all takes a lot of time and effort. This is where repositories come in.
A repository will make space available to you to deposit your work.
GitHub, as a whole, could be seen as a repository, although you also
create repositories (repos) yourself inside GitHub. It also does a lot
more than just hold your data/code, and of course its main function is
version control.</p>
<p>In the last episode we saw some repositories - <a href="https://about.zenodo.org" class="external-link">Zenodo</a> and the University’s
institutional repository <a href="https://orda.shef.ac.uk" class="external-link">ORDA</a> -
but there are many more out there. Most repositories, certainly used in
academia, tend to be fully open, so anyone can access what is
deposited.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember this, as you may not want, or be able to,
make your code fully open to all (although we encourage you to where
possible). However, there are repositories out there that have different
levels of access. For example, the <a href="https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/" class="external-link">UK Data Service repository</a> has
three levels of access: open, safeguarded (users must sign the End User
Licence), and controlled (users must apply for access with criteria set
by the data provider). However, currently the UK Data Service does not
hold code.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that there are different types of
repositories. Some are purely for publications (such as the <a href="https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/" class="external-link">White Rose Research Online
repository</a>), whereas others are data-focused (e.g. <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/" class="external-link">Harvard Dataverse</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="differences-between-repositories">Differences between repositories<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#differences-between-repositories"></a>
</h2>
<p>As we’ve just seen, not all repositories are created equal. Some are
not just repositories, others aren’t technically repositories at all.
This means you should put some thought into which repository you are
going to use to deposit your code.</p>

<li>Do you need your work to be machine-accessible?</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>You may also need to think about what licence you <em>can</em> apply,
as you may be limited by any third party software you are using. This is
covered in more detail in the Software Licensing section of this
component.</p>
<p>Also the last point is probably more important around data rather
than code.</p>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="choosing-a-repository">Choosing a repository<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#choosing-a-repository"></a>
</h2>
<p>As there are many different repositories out there, choosing a
suitable one for your code is an important task. You may know the
repository that you wish to use already, or you may wish to find a
suitable subject-specific repository. Both <a href="http://re3data.org" class="external-link">re3data</a> and <a href="http://fairsharing.org" class="external-link">FAIRsharing</a> hold a directory of
repositories that can be browsed, searched, and filtered to help you
find the most suitable repository for your needs.</p>

</figure><p>Both have a useful description of each repository and helpful icons
to enable you to quickly answer some of the questions listed above.</p>
<p>Our own guidance is that you should look for a subject- or
data-type-specific repository first, and if nothing is suitable or has
the functionality required, then you should use ORDA (the University of
Sheffield institutional repository).</p>

<p>Maybe! But also probably not. The main issue is that they are
different things really, or at least help and aid in different ways, but
use a lot of the same vocabulary. While a package will most likely make
it much easier for people to use you work (a simple install command), it
often doesn’t make it more citeable.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>For example, the main repository of Python packages - the Python
Package Index or <a href="http://pypi.org" class="external-link">PyPI</a> - holds over half a
million projects, but does not mint a DOI for these projects. However,
recently, all R packages on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/" class="external-link">CRAN</a> have been attributed a DOI.
Now of course there’s differences there in how packages are regulated,
but it’s a good step forward in giving the creators of packages the
recognition they deserve.</p>
<p>This is also the issue with using just GitHub that while it holds all
your work, and enables people to access, read, use, and reuse your work,
it also does not mint DOIs, as its main function is to aid in version
control and allow a team to work on the same project at once. Therefore,
unlike other repositories, it is not so concerned with the long-term
storage or archiving of work , and, while nothing has happened yet, it’s
also worth remembering that GitHub is owned by Microsoft and could
technically change at any time.</p>
<p>You can learn a lot more about packages in the FAIR<sup>2</sup>4RS
component on this topic, including how to create and publish your own
and how to automate the publication.</p>
<p>You may also consider the fact that while usually it is good practice
to only put your work in one repository, it might be beneficial in this
instance to have a package created for easy download, and also place
your work in a repository that grants a DOI for better citation. (Note:
it’s bad practice to gain more than one DOI for an output).</p>

<figure><img src="../fig/ORDA_my_data_image.png" alt="A screenshot of the 'My data' page in ORDA" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">“Image 3 - The ‘My data’ page of ORDA”</div>
</figure><p>You might be able to see it now, but it’s still not clear how useful
that button is. Next to the ‘+ Create a new item’ button is a greyed out
Octocat. Hovering over this will fill in the colour and provide the
helpful words ‘Import from GitHub’. Clicking on the icon will give you
this popup:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/ORDA_github_link_image.png" alt="A screenshot of the popup to link a GitHub account to ORDA, found in ORDA." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">“Image 4 - Linking of GitHub to ORDA
section”</div>
</figure><p>And from this you can link your account, and pull in a repo directly
to ORDA. You can see from the image below that it simply allows you to
select which repo you want to pull across.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/ORDA_github_repo_selection_image.png" alt="A screenshot showing how your repos are displayed to pull across in ORDA" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">“Image 5 - GitHub repos available for selection
to deposit”</div>
</figure><p>There are a few other bits of interest in this image as well. First,
you can see that if a GitHub repo has been imported by another user, it
doesn’t let you create another deposit for it (remember, this would mint
another DOI for the same output), and this is across all instances of
Figshare (for example that one is in the main Figshare.com instance).
There is also a simple option that you can see there that allows
automated updates of your GitHub repositories to be pulled into ORDA:
the slider between the repo name and last modified date.</p>
<p>However, that automation is reliant on the use of a GitHub Action,
which might not be the best approach for you (<a href="https://github.com/figshare/github-upload-action" class="external-link">guidance on the
Action</a>).</p>
<p>Alternatively you could use Figshare’s API to automate the creation
of a new version. There’s a much more detailed description and example
of how to do this in the Packages component of this course.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, if you are thinking of having both a package in a
repository, and depositing somewhere else to get a DOI, this is
something you give good consideration to, as they may be extra work to
ensure that there are not different versions of your work in different
places.</p>

</h2>
<p>Simply put, metadata is data about data (hence meta). This might not
be that helpful a description however, but is necessary as it holds true
across all types of metadata. If we continue with the idea of depositing
your code in a repository as we saw in the previous episode, however, it
becomes much clearer. The metadata is the data that’s on the deposit
‘front’ page, so to speak. It is there to inform anyone who comes across
the deposit what they have found without them having to dive too far
into the actual data or code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="can-you-show-me-some-good-metadata">Can you show me some good metadata?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#can-you-show-me-some-good-metadata"></a>
</h2>
<p>Of course, however, it might be more interesting to look at some bad
metadata, as it’s probably more effective in showing how important
metadata can be.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/ORDA_bad_metadata_example.png" alt="A screenshot showing a deposit in ORDA with bad metadata" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">“Image 1 - ORDA example of bad metadata”</div>
</figure><p>As you can see there, there’s some information about the deposit, but
it’s probably not nearly enough for anyone to know what it really is, or
if it’s useful to them. This code could be perfect for someone to use,
or adapt, but they wouldn’t know without having to do a lot of work to
figure this out. There is a link to the GitHub repository, but that’s
probably not got any more information in it, and still, as we’ve seen,
that wouldn’t enable someone to reference your work. (N.B. There’s no
DOI on this deposit, as it’s just a draft - we wouldn’t really accept a
deposit into ORDA that had so little information - another good reason
to think about metadata, as ORDA isn’t an outlier in this regard).</p>
<p>But there is a README there, which asks the question:</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="is-a-readme-metadata">Is a README metadata?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#is-a-readme-metadata"></a>
</h2>
<p>It’s a good question, and one I’m sure people would argue over as
they have different views on it. Technically, metadata is for finding
software, while documentation, including READMEs, are for understanding
it. However, the thing that actually matters is that you should probably
have a README, and metadata, and other documentation as well. READMEs
and other documentation (comments etc.) should be created early and
updated as you go along, with potentially metadata being created later
in the lifecycle. However, a good README may directly feed into your
metadata. There’s no problem with copying and pasting elements; in fact
it can be beneficial: it saves you time, and makes sure everything is
consistent.</p>
<p>It might be worth thinking of metadata as the overarching information
about your code. A README goes into more detail but covers the whole
software/project, and comments etc are much more fine-grained
documentation relating to the places in the code where they reside.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="https://github.com/Joe-Heffer-Shef/FAIR4RS-Documentation/tree/main" class="external-link">Documentation</a>
module on this FAIR<sup>2</sup>4RS course, which goes over all things
documentation in more detail.</p>

<p>These might not even be everything depending on what you have

reduces the workload or thought that someone has to take on in order to
know what it is they’re looking at, and if it’s useful to them.</p>
<p>None of these are world-changing ideas, but they do require some
thought:</p>

<p><em>“There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache
invalidation and naming things.”</em></p>
<p>– Phil Karlton</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>You may have heard or seen this quote before, but it does stand true:
naming things is hard. This principle is normally applied to variables,
but it does carry over to other elements too. Creating a short,
informative summary or description can be tricky, but doing that using
no specialised vocabulary makes it harder, as does trying to include all
the less tangible, or overarching, elements that you know about your
work but others do not.</p>
<p>If we go back to the example of bad metadata that we saw earlier,
there are actually two bits of information there that are helpful.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It’s got the right type of item type selected, as it’s down as
‘software’, which makes it easier for people to find and know
immediately what it is.</li>
<li>It also mentions that it’s mostly to do with ‘wrangling of health
data’. This is not much information, but it can be very easy to forget
the most simple elements. If you’ve only ever worked with health data
and written plenty of bits of code to help, you might not think to
mention this very high-level piece of information.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="machine-findable">Machine-findable<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#machine-findable"></a>
</h2>
<p>It’s best when thinking about creating metadata that you think of
human users. It’s also really good to think of yourself as one of these
users, either yourself a few years ago, when you might have known less
of the area and might not have known exactly what you were looking for,
or yourself in a few years, when you’ve most likely forgotten everything
about this code, why you made it, and what exactly it does.</p>
<p>However, you also get a bit more findability for free by creating
metadata, as these fields are often used and standardised for machine
readability as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="a-good-example">A good example<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#a-good-example"></a>
</h2>
<p>We’ve seen a bad example, but what would a good example look
like?</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/ORDA_good_metadata_example.png" alt="A screenshot showing a deposit in ORDA with good metadata" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">“Image 2 - ORDA example of good metadata”</div>
</figure><div class="Challenge">
<p>Can you pick out the good (and bad) elements of metadata in the above
deposit?</p>
<div class="Solution">
<ul>
<li>Author names</li>
<li>Version number</li>
<li>Date created</li>
<li>Item type</li>

<li>Categories and keywords</li>
<li>Related materials including a link to the relevant paper</li>
<li><em>Initialism in title (bad)</em></li>
</ul>

</div>
<p>There’s also the language that it is written in, both in the
description and the keywords. The first three listed, names, version,
and date, would all fall under what was previously referred to as
provenance. As you can see, a lot of these are fields you probably have
to complete when making a deposit to a repository, which makes it
easier, but if you are taking a different route, these could be easy to
miss out. It’s also important that you keep these items up to date if
they change. Do also take a bit of time to consider them - for example,
it’s not good form to miss someone off an author list, and this applies
to software author lists as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="standards">Standards<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#standards"></a>
</h2>
<p>As we’ve just seen, a repository, even a GitHub repository, has
fields for some of this information and these will be implementing a
standard, but if you are adding metadata that isn’t a standard
GitHub/repository field, or creating your own metadata document, you
might need to consider using a standard for your metadata. Some examples
are schema.org’s <a href="https://schema.org/SoftwareApplication" class="external-link">SoftwareApplication</a>
type, and <a href="https://codemeta.github.io/" class="external-link">CodeMeta</a>. These help
tools to work with your metadata by having a set standard. For example
if you created it now, what would you call your author list field?
Possibilities might be author_list, authorList, developer, developers,
writer, creator, coders etc., are all these synonymous with each other
for everyone? Would you complete those fields the same for your project?
Implementing a standard stops this from happening, each field has a
precise meaning and information on how to complete/read.</p>
<p>You’ll have come across standards before, of course, when you
download citations of papers for your reference manager software:</p>

<p>If we go back to the first thing that was stated in this module,</p>
<p><em>The code that you write is important. No matter the size, style,
or language, it is an integral aspect of the research that it is part
of, or indeed, sometimes it is the main output of the research
project.</em>,</p>
<p>This also applies to code that other people write. That’s why it’s
important to know that you can (and should) cite other people’s code
when you use it, and also how to enable other people to cite yours.</p>

</h2>
<!--- ask about any other elements, the importance of other outputs, not just papers --->
<p><a href="https://sfdora.org/" class="external-link">DORA</a>, The Declaration on Research
Assessment, sets out to improve the ways in which the outputs of
scholarly research are evaluated, essentially moving away from a focus
on the impact factor of journals that you publish in. The University of
Sheffield is a signatory of this declaration. DORA prompts institutions
and the sector as a whole to consider <a href="https://sfdora.org/read/" class="external-link">different ways of evaluating research
quality</a>, including assessing the quality of all research outputs
(e.g. datasets, code) as well as published journal articles, and
encouraging recognition of all authors’ contributions.</p>
<p>We’re also seeing a continued movement from funders to make open and
available all aspects of research projects as the importance and cost of
all elements are more fully recognised. For instance, we’ve seen this
with data, with a lot of funders requiring (where suitable) this to be
made openly accessible, and we’re also increasingly seeing it with code.
Making things open and reusing existing work are both important goals,
and ensuring people get the recognition they deserve from their work is
essential (and also in most cases a legal necessity - see licence
section of this module, or software Terms and Conditions e.g. <a href="https://www.sas.com/en_gb/legal/editorial-guidelines.html" class="external-link">SAS</a>).</p>
<p>There’s also been some movement with the REF as well, with more types
of outputs being considered eligible to be returned, and if we think
about impact case studies, a useful piece of software could easily have
a substantial impact. There are also movements like the <a href="https://hidden-ref.org/the-5-percent-manifesto/" class="external-link">Hidden REF</a>,
whose objective is to gain recognition for all people who contribute to
research, and are also wanting institutions to pledge to making 5% of
their REF returns non-traditional research outputs (i.e. anything that’s
not a journal paper or book).</p>
<p>These are also all good reasons not to simply cite the associated
paper for a piece of software (if there even is one), but to cite the
software itself - and to make it easy for others to cite your own
code.</p>

<p>Citation of software is of course different to that of a standard
journal article. Normally there is one version of an article and nothing
that can really ‘break’ with them; this is not true of software. Also, a
paper tends to have all the information you need to cite it correctly
quite clearly there for you - again, this often isn’t the case for
software.</p>

<p>Think what people might need to know from a citation to be able to

same piece of software used in the original study?)</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Some of the main things to know about the software used that would be
integral to being able to reproduce the outputs would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Title</li>
<li>Authors</li>
<li>Version used</li>
<li>Where to find the software</li>
<li>How to access the code (if different to the above, and

</ul>
<p>The first two, while it’s clear that they should be part of a
citation, might not immediately seem relevant when thinking about
reproducibility, but if you think that they can sometimes act as a kind
of ‘primary key’ to help people know they’re working with the right
software (see the last episode and its discussion of naming things).</p>
<p>The bottom three you can see would be needed in order to be certain
you can reproduce the work as best as possible. We know that many
changes can happen between versions, some big changes, some small
changes that could have knock-on effects to how everything works. Of
course, where to find the software goes back to our first episode, and
having a solid pointer to the code can be solved by getting a DOI for
your work (you should of course not mint a DOI for other people’s work,
and you might just have to cite the best link available).</p>

everything you or others need in one place. Similar to README, or

  While putting your software online certainly helps it satisfy the FAIR principles, simply doing so might not be enough for other researchers to actually find and utilise what you’ve put out there.

  It’s important to know the benefits and issues with where you store and publish your data, and to make the most of the tools these platforms provide, such as Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). It’s also important to know best practice for how to increase the visibility and citability of your work in cases where your chosen platform lacks these features.

  This course will introduce and explore worked examples of elements that you should consider when publishing your software, which will help you easily reference your work, and also help make it more findable and reusable by others.

<p>As you can see, this has all the relevant metadata needed for full
citation, and you can see where it was created. This has also been
updated manually as well when things have changed, but there are lots of
places online where you can see the fields needed and the style they
should be in if you have a quick search.</p>

will be able to get the citation text, or download one to be imported

<p>GitHub is not the only platform to make use of
<code>CITATION.cff</code> files; however, not every platform or
repository uses them either. As previously mentioned, you can link your
GitHub repos to ORDA, the University of Sheffield repository, and ORDA
has an easy way of creating citations as well:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/ORDA_citation_example.png" alt="A screenshot showing the a citiation created by ORDA." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">“Image 2 - ORDA citiation creation”</div>
</figure><p>However, the two citations that we’ve just seen for the same output
are not the same. The issue comes with the fact that Figshare (which the
University of Sheffield repository, ORDA, is an instance of), does not
look in the <code>CITATION.cff</code> file, but instead creates one from
the metadata that is entered for the deposit. In this example, the
author list is different as I’ve entered all authors into the
<code>CITATION.cff</code> file, but have not edited this in ORDA. It’s
easy to add these, but it means repetition of work. While this isn’t
ideal, it’s important to try to get everything the same where possible.
You don’t know where your work may end up once it’s been made open, so
controlling what you can to start with really improves chances of the
provenance being kept with it, and the ability of people to find the
original repository. The <code>CITATION.cff</code> file should also
always be kept with your work if it does get shared onwards, and helps
to this end as well.</p>

<p>There are also a lot of standardised fields that you can add to your
<code>CITATION.cff</code> file, other than the ones we have already
seen. You can link to a related journal article if there is one, or you
could cite a dataset that is contained in your GitHub repo. For more
information about these extensions, GitHub provides an easy-to-follow <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-citation-files" class="external-link">help
page</a> on the subject.</p>

<ul>
<li>Citation is important to ensure that the correct recognition and
credit is assigned to all work</li>
<li>Citation of software differs from that of articles, but is needed to
aid the reproducibility of work</li>
<li>
<code>CITATION.cff</code> files should contain all the necessary
metadata and help create citations for use.</li>
<li>You may need to complete the relevant fields in multiple places to
ensure correct citation in all cases.</li>
